# Geom-GCN torch implementation (No DGL)
Torch version re-implementation of paper [Geom-GCN: Geometric Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05287).
The [original code](https://github.com/graphdml-uiuc-jlu/geom-gcn) implemented by authors used DGL library.
For those who does not want to use DGL, I modified original code.
